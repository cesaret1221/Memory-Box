MERN stack is a popular technology stack used for developing web applications. It is composed of four different technologies, namely MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. Together, these technologies provide developers with a powerful platform to build efficient and robust web applications.

One of the most common use cases for MERN stack is creating a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) system. In this article, we will discuss how to create a base CRUD system using MERN stack.

MongoDB
MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database that is used for storing data in JSON-like format. It is an open-source, document-oriented database that provides high scalability and flexibility. MongoDB is a perfect fit for MERN stack applications because of its flexible data structure, which is ideal for storing JSON objects.

To start with the CRUD system, we need to create a MongoDB database to store our data. To do this, we need to install MongoDB and start the server. Once the server is up and running, we can use the MongoDB command line interface or a GUI tool like MongoDB Compass to create a new database and collection.

Express.js
Express.js is a lightweight web application framework that is used for building web applications in Node.js. It provides a set of robust features for building web applications, such as routing, middleware, and templating engines. Express.js is used to create the server-side application that will handle HTTP requests and responses.

To start with the CRUD system, we need to create an Express.js application. We can do this by installing the express package using npm and creating a new server.js file. In the server.js file, we can create a new instance of the Express.js application and define the necessary routes to handle CRUD operations.

React.js
React.js is a popular JavaScript library used for building user interfaces. It is a powerful tool for creating dynamic web applications with a smooth user experience. React.js is used to create the client-side application that will communicate with the server-side application created using Express.js.

To start with the CRUD system, we need to create a new React.js application. We can do this by using the create-react-app tool provided by Facebook. Once the application is created, we can start building the user interface components that will interact with the server-side application.

Node.js
Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It provides a set of powerful features for building server-side applications, such as file system access, network communication, and database connectivity. Node.js is used to create the server-side application that will handle HTTP requests and responses.

To start with the CRUD system, we need to install Node.js on our machine. Once Node.js is installed, we can use it to run the server-side application created using Express.js. The server-side application will be responsible for handling CRUD operations, while the client-side application created using React.js will be responsible for displaying the data to the user and sending requests to the server.

Creating the Base CRUD System
To create the base CRUD system, we need to follow these steps:

Create a MongoDB database and collection to store data.
Create an Express.js application to handle HTTP requests and responses.
Create a React.js application to interact with the server-side application.
Define the necessary routes in the server-side application to handle CRUD operations.
Create the necessary components in the client-side application to display data and interact with the server-side application.
Let's discuss each step in detail:

1. Creating a MongoDB Database and Collection
To create a MongoDB database and collection, we can follow these steps:

Install MongoDB on our machine.
Start the MongoDB server.
Use the MongoDB CLI or GUI tool to create a new database and collection.
